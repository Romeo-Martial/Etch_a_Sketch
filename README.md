# Etch-a-Sketch

A digital recreation of the classic Etch-a-Sketch toy built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Draw by hovering your mouse over the grid squares!

## Features

- **Dynamic Grid Creation**: Create grids from 1x1 up to 100x100 squares
- **Mouse Drawing**: Draw by simply hovering your mouse over the grid squares
- **Responsive Design**: Grid adapts to viewport size for consistent drawing experience
- **Clean Interface**: Simple, intuitive controls with a retro-inspired design

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Click the **"New Grid"** button to start
3. Enter your desired grid size (1-100 squares per side) when prompted
4. Start drawing by moving your mouse over the grid squares
5. Create a new grid anytime by clicking the "New Grid" button again

## Demo

The application creates a square grid where each cell changes to black when you hover over it with your mouse, simulating the drawing experience of a traditional Etch-a-Sketch.
